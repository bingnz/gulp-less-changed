# `gulp-less-changed`

> A [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin to pass through LESS files only if they or their dependencies have changed

Analyses LESS files and their dependencies, i.e., imports and files included using `data-uri`, to save wasting time
regenerating output.

## Install

```
$ npm install gulp-less-changed --save-dev
```

## Example

### Using `gulp-less-changed` where the CSS output is generated next to the LESS input

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const lessChanged = require('gulp-less-changed');
const less = require('gulp-less');

gulp.task('default', () => {
    return gulp.src('src/*.less')
        .pipe(lessChanged())
        .pipe(less())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('src'));
});
```

### Using `gulp-less-changed` where the CSS output has a different path and extension

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const lessChanged = require('gulp-less-changed');
const rename = require('rename');
const less = require('gulp-less');
const cleanCss = require('gulp-clean-css');
const gulpRename = require('gulp-rename');

const OutputPath = 'dest';
const MinifiedExtension = '.min.css';

gulp.task('default', () => {
    return gulp.src('src/*.less')
        .pipe(lessChanged({
            getOutputFileName: file => rename(file, { dirname: OutputPath, extname: MinifiedExtension })
        }))
        .pipe(less())
        .pipe(cleanCss())
        .pipe(gulpRename({ extname: MinifiedExtension }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(OutputPath));
});
```
### Using `gulp-less-changed` for incremental builds

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const lessChanged = require('gulp-less-changed');
const rename = require('rename');
const less = require('gulp-less');
const cleanCss = require('gulp-clean-css');
const gulpRename = require('gulp-rename');

const OutputPath = 'dest';
const MinifiedExtension = '.min.css';

gulp.task('css', () => {
    return gulp.src('src/*.less')
        .pipe(lessChanged({
            getOutputFileName: file => rename(file, { dirname: OutputPath, extname: MinifiedExtension })
        }))
        .pipe(less())
        .pipe(cleanCss())
        .pipe(gulpRename({ extname: MinifiedExtension }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(OutputPath));
});

gulp.task('default', () => {
    return gulp.watch('src/*.less', ['css']);
});
```

As an optimisation, the import list for each file is kept in memory and on disk. If all of the imports for a particular file have the same timestamp,
the import list for that file is assumed to be the same. This helps to speed up incremental builds.

## API

### lessChanged([options])

For each input LESS file in the Gulp stream, looks for the corresponding CSS file. If the LESS file has a later timestamp than its
corresponding CSS file, or if any of the LESS file's imports has a later timestamp than the CSS file, the LESS file is emitted to the stream.

If no options are specified, looks for a CSS file in the same path as the LESS file with a .css extension. Otherwise:

 * **options.getOutputFileName** - `function` Map source paths to destination paths
   (e.g. `function(path) { return rename(path, { extname: 'min.css' }); }`)
   Overrides the default behaviour of looking for .css files in the input path.
 * **options.paths** - `string[]` Search paths for `@import`s and files referenced using `data-uri`. This
   works in the same way as the `paths` option for [gulp-less](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-less).
   Additional less options such as `globalVars` can also be used: internally, less is used to discover imports. This means that
   paths can be evaluated using less syntax.
